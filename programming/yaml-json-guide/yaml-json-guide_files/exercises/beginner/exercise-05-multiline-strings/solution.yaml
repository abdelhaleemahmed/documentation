# Exercise 5: Multiline Strings - Solution

deployment:
  name: "myapp"
  description: >
    This is a very long description
    that spans multiple lines but
    should be folded into a single
    line when parsed.

  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Starting deployment..."
    npm install
    npm run build
    echo "Deployment complete!"
