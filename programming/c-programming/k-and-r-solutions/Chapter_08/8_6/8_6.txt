In this example we use:
stat:
	The stat system call takes a file name and returns all of the information in the inode for that file, or -1if there is an error.
	
	The stat structure describing the value returnted by stat is in <sys/stat.h>.
	
	dev_t and ino_t (defined in stat structure) are defined in <sys/types.h>, which must be included too.
	
<fcntl.h>: flags for read and write.
	
Read info and man pages for <sys/types> (Open the file alos).

Opendir, Readdir, Clodsedir:
	are system specific.
	they use the informations in the header <sys/dir.h>.

	Opendir use fstat which is like stat except that it applies to a file descriptor.
